This is a testsuite for testing libpq URI connection string syntax.

To run the suite, use 'make installcheck' command.  It works by
running regress.sh from this directory with appropriate environment
set up.

The test itself works by running the psql command installed by 'make
install' with different -d option arguments and collecting the output,
then comparing that to the expected 'correct' output.

The test script assumes that the server is running on localhost and
accepting local and IPv4,6 connections on port $PGPORT.  Attempts to
connect are made from user $PGUSER (which defaults to $USER,) to the
default database (that is, $PGUSER again.)  The default database is
created by the script prior to running the actual tests.

The connection URI lines to test are read from the file 'regress.in',
and are eval-d before passing them to psql (like `eval echo $line`,)
thus ${variable} substitutions are carried out.
